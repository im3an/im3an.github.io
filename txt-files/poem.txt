In shadows deep, 
where darkness lies, 
A soul adrift, 
with mournful cries. 

Lost in the void, 
no light to see, 
A shattered heart, 
longing to be free.

Whispers echo,
through endless night, 
Haunting dreams, 
a chilling fright. 

Memories fade, 
like stars above,
A silent plea, 
for a shred of love.

Tears fall like rain, 
upon barren land, 
A broken vessel, 
upon shifting sand. 

Hopeless whispers, 
in silent despair, 
A soul in anguish, 
beyond repair.

In the depths of sorrow, 
where demons dwell, 
A soul in torment, 
trapped in hell. 

Echoes of laughter, 
now twisted and cold, 
A tale of woe, 
forever untold.

In the silence of night, 
where shadows creep, 
A heartache lingers, 
in dreams so deep. 

Lost in the darkness, 
forevermore, 
A soul cries out, 
to the endless shore.

But even in darkness, 
a flicker of light, 
A glimmer of hope, 
in the dead of night.

A distant whisper, 
a faint refrain, 
A soul in pain, 
but not in vain.

For in the depths of despair, 
where shadows lie, 
A spark of resilience, 
begins to rise. 

A journey of healing, 
a path to find, 
A soul in darkness, 
with strength to bind.

But the poem remains unfinished, 
a tale untold, 
A journey of sorrow, 
yet to unfold. 

For in the darkness,
there lies a spark, 
A glimmer of hope, 
in the endless dark.
