hey again, diary,

still awake. can't seem to shut my brain off, no matter how hard I try. 
it's like my mind's stuck in this fog, swirling around with thoughts I can't make sense of.

been lying here for hours, just staring at the ceiling. tired as shit, but sleep's playing hard to get. 
feels like I'm trapped in this never-ending loop of overthinking and self-doubt.

every little thing keeps replaying in my head, like a broken record that won't stop. 
can't escape the noise, can't find any peace.

it's like being locked in a prison for your mind, ya know? 
can't even get shit done 'cause my thoughts are running wild, pulling me in a million different directions.
  
imagine being lost in a dense fog, where every step forward feels uncertain and every turn leads to confusion. 
your mind becomes enveloped in a thick haze, obscuring clarity and leaving you disoriented. 
thoughts swirl around like wisps of mist, twisting and tangling until they form an impenetrable barrier.

it's like standing on the edge of a vast abyss, peering into the darkness below but unable to see the bottom. 
each thought echoes back with a hollow emptiness, amplifying the sense of isolation and despair.

every attempt to grasp onto a thought is like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands – 
fleeting and elusive. you're trapped in a labyrinth of your own creation, with no clear path forward and no end in sight.

the weight of exhaustion bears down on your shoulders like a leaden cloak, dragging you further into the depths of mental fatigue. 
yet, sleep remains just out of reach, a distant oasis shimmering on the horizon.

In this fog of overthinking and uncertainty, time becomes distorted, stretching and contracting like a warped mirror. 
minutes feel like hours, and hours feel like mere seconds, blurring the boundaries between reality and delusion.

it's a suffocating feeling, this prison for the mind, where even the simplest tasks become Herculean challenges. 
yet, amidst the darkness, a flicker of hope remains – the belief that someday, somehow, the fog will lift, and clarity will prevail. 
until then, you navigate the labyrinth of your thoughts, clinging to the hope that dawn will eventually break through the darkness.

just wanna shut it all out, even if it's just for a little while. 
but sleep keeps slipping through my fingers, leaving me stranded in this dark abyss of my own making.

guess I'll keep trying. maybe eventually I'll find some peace.
