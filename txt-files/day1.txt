hey diary,

so, today was kinda strange. hung out with the team at this coffee place, but everything felt like it was on fast forward.
people rushing around, talking a mile a minute, but I just couldn't keep up. it's like I was stuck in slow motion while the world whizzed by.

didn't really catch much of what my friends were saying. they were all laughing and chatting away, but I was just zoning out, lost in my own thoughts.
it's like I was there, but not really there, y'know?

anyway, after that, I headed home. felt like I needed some space to clear my head.
so, I opened up this notepad on my laptop and started writing. kinda weird, talking to you like this, but it feels good to get stuff off my chest.

right here, right now, as we speak.
