sup, diary,

been a minute, huh? sorry 'bout that, guess I kinda lost track of time. 
or maybe I just didn't feel like writing. who knows?

anyway, been cooped up in the house for days now. don't really feel like going out much anymore. 
don't really feel like doing much of anything, to be honest.

eating's been... well, let's just say instant noodles and pizza have become my best friends. not exactly the healthiest diet, but who cares, right?

been feeling kinda... off lately. like everything's just a blur, ya know? 
thoughts all jumbled up in my head, can't seem to make sense of anything anymore.

don't even know why I'm writing this. guess she recommended I keep doing it. said it might help or something. 
not sure I believe her, but what have I got to lose, right?

anyway, gonna try and get some sleep. or at least pretend to.
