been tryin' my damn best to keep it together, but shit's been getting real weird lately. 
can't shake this feelin' like I'm losin' my grip on reality.

started seein' things – or at least, I think I am. glimpses of Mom and Dad, even though I know they ain't here no more. 
how the hell is that possible, huh? must be losin' it, goin' crazy in the head.

feel like I'm drownin' in a sea of madness, and I can't fuckin' swim. 
angry as hell at myself for bein' so damn weak, for lettin' my mind play these fucked-up tricks on me.

tryin' to write this shit down, but it's like my thoughts are runnin' wild, tearin' through my brain like a tornado. 
can't even make sense of half the shit I'm sayin' anymore.

like... what if the walls are watchin' me, huh? what if they're whisperin' secrets to each other, plottin' against me? 
sounds crazy as fuck, I know, but can't shake the feelin' that it's true.

sometimes, I feel like I'm bein' followed. like there's someone – or somethin' – lurkin' in the shadows, just waitin' to pounce. 
got me lookin' over my shoulder every damn second, heart poundin' in my chest like a jackhammer.

guess I'm just... scared. scared of what's happenin' to me, scared of what I might become. 
feelin' like I'm trapped in a nightmare, and there ain't no wakin' up from it.

gotta keep fightin', gotta keep pushin' through. 
but fuck, it's gettin' harder and harder every damn day.

fuck.
