been a while since i wrote last, huh? can't remember why i stopped. 
was it because i didn't have anything to say? or because i didn't want to face the truth?

can't seem to shake this feeling of emptiness. it's like a void inside me, sucking away every last bit of happiness. 
why do i feel this way? what did i do to deserve this?

the solitude... it's suffocating. been months since i stepped foot outside. months since i've seen another human being. 
isolation creeping in like ivy, wrapping around me tighter and tighter. 

can't breathe, can't think, can't...

one of my friends... he's gone now. took his own life. 
shouldn't i feel something? shouldn't i cry, scream, rage against the unfairness of it all? but i didn't. 
why didn't i cry? why do i feel nothing?

dark thoughts swirling in my mind, like a storm brewing on the horizon. 
why do i entertain them? why do i let them consume me, devouring every last shred of hope?

i don't know, diary. i don't know anything anymore. 
can't even trust my own thoughts. they whisper to me in the dead of night, taunting me with their cruel truths.

maybe i'm broken. maybe i've always been broken, and i just didn't know it. 
why can't i fix myself? why do i feel so irreparably damaged?

questions without answers. 
that's all i have left. 


note: do not let them in
