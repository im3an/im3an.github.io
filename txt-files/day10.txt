it's hard to put into words what i'm feeling right now. like i'm trapped in a nightmare, but i can't wake up.

the shadows... they're getting closer. 
can't shake the feeling that they're reaching out for me, trying to pull me into their darkness.

every time i close my eyes, i see their faces. twisted, contorted, like something out of a horror movie. 
can't escape them, can't escape this nightmare.

but there's something else too. something i can't quite put my finger on. a feeling of... desperation? longing? 
i don't know.

maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me. 
maybe i'm losing it, like everyone says.

but i can't shake this feeling that there's something more. 

something hidden, waiting to be uncovered.
