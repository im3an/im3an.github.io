Feels like it's been forever since I last wrote. 
Can't seem to keep track of time these days. Everything's just... slipping away, you know?

My plant... I used to talk about her like she was still here, like she was keeping me company. 
But she's gone now. Can't remember when she died, can't even remember her name. Feels like I'm losing pieces of myself, bit by bit.

And my boss... what a trip that turned out to be. Used to think he was a total jerk, always breathing down my neck and making my life miserable. 
But then he said something... something about the "truth about me." Can't remember exactly what it was, but it hit me like a ton of bricks.

Now, I... I don't know. I think I kinda like him. Maybe he's not so bad after all. 
Maybe he sees something in me that I don't.

I dunno, diary. Everything's all jumbled up in my head. Can't make sense of anything anymore. 

But I'll keep writing. 
Maybe if I keep writing, I won't forget everything.
