so, today was a bit more chill. decided to stay in, y'know, take it easy.
went out and got myself a new plant. not sure why, just felt like I needed something to take care of. hope she doesn't die on me.

made myself some breakfast, nothing fancy, just eggs and toast.
sat down in front of the TV and flipped through the channels. ended up watching the news for a bit.

heard something about the suicide rates being higher than last year.
kinda messed up, if you ask me. don't really know how to feel about it. just makes you wonder what's going on in people's heads, y'know?

guess I'll just keep taking it one day at a time.
