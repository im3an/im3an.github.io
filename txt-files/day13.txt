hey diary,

or is it even you? can't tell anymore. can't tell much of anything these days. 
everything's blurrry, like trying to see through a fog that never lifts, that wraps around me tighter and tighter with each passing moment.

the room... it's white. everything's white. blinding, suffocating. can't breathe, can't think. where am i? who am i? does it even matter? 
Walls stretch endlessly, no corners to hide, no escape from this sterile prison. Time melts away like wax in a flame, 
leaving me stranded in an eternal now, a timeless void where seconds stretch into infinity.

the pen... it's white too. or is it? can't see it anymore. can't feel it. can't feel anything. numbness creeping in, swallowing me whole. 
Fingers trace lines on paper that I can't see, can't comprehend. Ink flows from a source unknown, writing words that disappear as soon as they're formed. 
A futile attempt to grasp onto something tangible, something real in a world that slips through my fingers like sand.

thoughts... racing. or are they? can't make sense of them. gibberish, nonsense. like trying to catch smoke with my bare hands. 
Memories flicker like dying embers, fragments of a life once lived, now scattered to the winds. 
Faces blur into one, voices meld into a cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing. 
Questions echo in the emptiness, bouncing off walls that offer no answers, no solace, only endless silence.

pain... searing. or is it? can't feel it anymore. or maybe i feel it too much. burning, consuming. 
like a fire raging out of control, devouring everything in its path. 
Each breath a struggle, each heartbeat a reminder of my own mortality. 
But even pain fades into numbness, a distant memory of a sensation once felt, now lost to the void.

blood... red. or is it? can't see it anymore. can't taste it. can't smell it. just... red. everywhere. pooling at my feet, staining the white. 
A river of crimson flowing from wounds unseen, a testament to the violence within, the chaos that reigns supreme. 
But even blood loses its meaning in a world devoid of life, a canvas painted with the colors of despair.

end it... all. or do i? 

can't decide anymore. can't think straight. can't think at all. just... end. it. all. 

The urge to escape, to break free from the shackles of existence, grows stronger with each passing moment. 
A primal scream trapped in the depths of my soul, begging for release, for oblivion. 

But even death offers no solace, no refuge from the torment that haunts me, that gnaws at my sanity like a ravenous beast.
